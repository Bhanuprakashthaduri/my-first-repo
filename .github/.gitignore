# Editor/Temporary Files
*.swp
.vscode/

# Example: If your OS generates them
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Other Projects/Demos (VERY IMPORTANT)

newrepository/
Save the .gitignore file.

2. Commit the New Content
The remaining file is probably one you do want to track:

test.html: This looks like a temporary file you created for testing. Decide if it's needed for the final project.

If you want to track and commit the test.html and the new .gitignore:

Bash

# Stage the .gitignore file and test.html
git add .gitignore test.html

# Commit the changes (using a descriptive message)
git commit -m "chore: add gitignore to exclude editor files, and include test.html"
3. Push to Remote
After the commit, your local main branch will be ahead of origin/main. Push the changes up to GitHub:

Bash

git push
Final Status Check:
After this, when you run git status, you should get the clean message:

Bash

$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
